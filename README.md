## Computer Science:
Everything I do has been derived from [Teach Yourself CS](teachyourselfcs.com).<br />

**Resources:**
1. Programming: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs <br />
I use MIT's version of Scheme with Ubuntu | [Prof. Brian Harvey's Class](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/)<br /><br />
    1. [Reading: SICP (MIT Press)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
    2. [Problems (UCB)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/Volume2/CS%2061A%20Course%20Reader,%20Volume%202.html)
    3. [Problems (UCB)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/Volume1/CS%2061A%20Course%20Reader,%20Volume%201.html)
    4. [Tracker (UCB)?](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61a/su10/index.html)
    5. [Lectures (by Prof. Brian Harvey of UCB)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9)
    6. [Even more lectures (by Prof Eric Grimson of MIT)!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7BcsI5ueSNFPCEisbaoQ0kXIDX9rR5FF)<br /> <br/>
    
```scheme
1 ]=> (define (is-good-SICP?))

;Value: is-good-sicp?

1 ]=> (is-good-SICP?)

;Unassigned variable: is-good-sicp?
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Complete SICP first.

## Mathematics:
I will do / will have done the following:
1. Calculus: <br />
        1. Reference book(s): [Elementary Calculus](https://archive.org/details/elementarycalcul00woodrich/page/n13/mode/2up) + [Advanced Calculus (pdf)](https://physicsgg.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/advanced_calculus_woods.pdf)<br />
Fun fact: Richard Feynman studied calculus from Advanced Calculus <br />
        2. Practice Book(s): [Differential and Integral Calculus](https://archive.org/details/n.-piskunov-differential-and-integral-calculus-mir-1969/mode/2up) and Prof. Jim Fowler's [mooculus (Ximera)](https://ximera.osu.edu/) <br />
        3. Lectures / Certification Courses: [Prof. Robert Ghrist's Calculus Courses](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/robghrist)


## Physics:
I will do / have done the following in the given order:
1. [Rice's Mechanics Course by Prof. Hafner](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-to-mechanics) + [Harvey Mudd's Physics Courses](https://www.edx.org/school/harveymuddx)
2. Problem Books like [Irodov](https://archive.org/details/IrodovProblemsInGeneralPhysics)
